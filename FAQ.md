# Cyber Resilience Frequently Asked Questions

## Section 1
Editors Note:
Eventually the FAQs will be organized into sections by topic.
But for now they are just random

Editors Note:
should we anchor/bookmark questions?
Can template do it? or do we need to put html inline -
see first faq for how ugly it looks.


### <a id="whatIsCyberResilience">What is Cyber Resilience?</a>
put answer here

"the ability to continuously deliver the intended outcome despite adverse events"
reference "Cyber Resilience - fundamentals for a definition" Bjorck et al,
https://www.researchgate.net/publication/283102782_Cyber_Resilience_-_Fundamentals_for_a_Definition

"the ability to prepare and plan for, to absorb, recover from, and more
successfully adapt to adverse events"
reference NAS via hausken
https://www.researchgate.net/publication/283102782_Cyber_Resilience_-_Fundamentals_for_a_Definition

"the ability of a system, person, or organization to recover from, defy
or resist from any shock, insult, or disturbance"
ref kishor via hausken

"Cyber resilience is the ability of an actor to resist, respond, and recover
from cyber incidents to ensure the actor's operational continuity"
ref Hausken

"assuming two equally performing systems A and B subjected
to an impact (resulting from a cyber-attack) that left both
systems with an equal performance degradation, the
resiliency of system A is greater if after a given period T
it recovers to a higher level of performance than that of
system B."
ref linkov

"The ability to anticipate, withstand, recover from, and
adapt to adverse conditions, stresses, attacks, or
compromises on systems that use or are enabled by cyber
resources."

NIST SP 800-172

"The ability to anticipate, withstand, recover from, and
adapt to adverse conditions, stresses, attacks, or
compromises on systems that use or are enabled by cyber
resources.
Cyber resiliency is intended to enable mission or
business objectives that depend on cyber resources to be
achieved in a contested cyber environment."
Source(s):
NIST SP 800-160 Vol. 2 Rev. 1
NIST SP 800-172A from NIST SP 800-160 Vol. 2 Rev. 1

"Cyber resilience is the ability of an organization to
transcend any stresses, failures, hazards and threats to its
cyber resources within the organization and its ecosystem,
such that the organization can confidently pursue its
mission, enable its culture and maintain its desired way of
operating."
https://www3.weforum.org/docs/WEF_Cyber_Resilience_Index_2022.pdf

“Cyber resilience refers to the ability to protect
electronic data and systems from cyberattacks, as well as to
resume business operations quickly in case of a successful
attack.”
https://www.ecb.europa.eu/paym/cyber-resilience/html/index.en.html

“‘Cyber resilience’ is the ability for organisations to
prepare for, respond to and recover from cyber attacks and
security breaches.”
https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/cyber-resilience

“The ability to anticipate, withstand, recover from, and
adapt to adverse conditions, stresses, attacks, or
compromises on systems that use or are enabled by cyber
resources.”
https://csrc.nist.gov/glossary/term/cyber_resiliency

“‘Cyber resiliency (also referred to as cyber resilience) is
the ability to anticipate, withstand, recover from, and
adapt to adverse conditions, stresses, attacks, or
compromises on cyber resources.”
https://www.mitre.org/sites/default/files/PR_17-1434.pdf

This is from Francesco – collated from various sources (mainly MITRE and ISF).
"The science of anticipation defined mission assurance. Mission assurance defines engineering practices to secure enterprises from advanced threats. Cyber resilience is part of mission assurance, focused on advanced cyber threats."
