# Cyber Resilience Frequently Asked Questions

## Section 1
Editors Note:
Eventually the FAQs will be organized into sections by topic.
But for now they are just random

Editors Note:
should we anchor/bookmark questions?
Can template do it? or do we need to put html inline -
see first faq for how ugly it looks.


### <a id="whatIsCyberResilience">What is Cyber Resilience?</a>
put answer here

"the ability to continuously deliver the intended outcome despite adverse events"
reference "Cyber Resilience - fundamentals for a definition" Bjorck et al,
https://www.researchgate.net/publication/283102782_Cyber_Resilience_-_Fundamentals_for_a_Definition

"the ability to prepare and plan for, to absorb, recover from, and more
successfully adapt to adverse events"
reference NAS via hausken
https://www.researchgate.net/publication/283102782_Cyber_Resilience_-_Fundamentals_for_a_Definition

"the ability of a system, person, or organization to recover from, defy
or resist from any shock, insult, or disturbance"
ref kishor via hausken

"Cyber resilience is the ability of an actor to resist, respond, and recover
from cyber incidents to ensure the actor's operational continuity"
ref Hausken

"assuming two equally performing systems A and B subjected to an impact (resulting from a cyber-attack) that left both systems with an equal performance degradation, the resiliency of system A is greater if after a given period T it recovers to a higher level of performance than that of system B."
ref linkov "assuming two equally ..."
