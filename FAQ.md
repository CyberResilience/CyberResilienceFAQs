# Cyber Resilience Frequently Asked Questions


### <a id="whatIsCyberResilience">What is Cyber Resilience?</a>

Cyber Resilience is achieved by making it costly and difficult for intruders to break into our environment and maintain presence in the systems, as well as strengthening the system-of-system’s ability to recover business functions after adversity. One of the first steps to kick-start a Cyber Resilience program is by identifying critical data, processes and systems that are high value assets and develop plans to address gaps in resiliency. Once identified, those key assets can be designed, implemented and maintained appropriately by leveraging existing cyber resilience best practices. This perspective is particularly relevant to address Advanced Persistent Threats (APT) which may execute a coordinated, destructive long-lasting attack towards an organization. APT actors aim to compromise not only the most vulnerable or less protected assets in order to carry out their mission. In fact, they may specifically decide to attack assets that can provide them maximum gain towards the achievement of their objectives. These assets are referred to as High Value Targets.

The ultimate definition of Cyber Resilience in different domains may be stated as follows:

Business world - Cyber Resilience is an outcome of Cyber Security and Operational Resilience and is defined as “the ability of an organization to transcend any stresses, failures, hazards and threats to its cyber resources within the organization and its ecosystem, such that the organization can confidently pursue its mission, enable its culture and maintain its desired way of operating” (WEF, 2022).

Technical world - Cyber Resilience is an extension of Cyber Security and is defined as “the ability to anticipate, withstand, recover from, and adapt to adverse conditions, stresses, attacks, or compromises on systems that use or are enabled by cyber resources. Cyber resiliency is intended to enable mission or business objectives that depend on cyber resources to be achieved in a contested cyber environment.” (NIST 800-160 v2 r1). Cyber Resilience is grounded on NIST 800-160 v2 r1 and MITRE CREF (the most authoritative industry resources known nowadays).

to an impact (resulting from a cyber-attack) that left both
systems with an equal performance degradation, the
resiliency of system A is greater if after a given period T
it recovers to a higher level of performance than that of
system B."

### What is the relationship between Cyber Resilience and Business Resilience?
Business Resilience is the ability for a business or organization to continue to move forward with its business purpose while reacting and recovering to unknown challenges.  It is generally a key driver for any risk program.  Business Resilience, and the policies and tolerances that are agreed upon by the risk office should be the drivers for a Cyber Resilience program.  In other words, a Cyber Resilience program should fufill the goals of a Business Resilience plan or program, where technology is concerned.

### How is NIST SP800-160 relevant for cyber resilience?
The NIST SP 800-160 (Vol. 2 Revision 1, 2021) is focused on the development of cyber resilient systems. Adopting a systems engineering foundation, this SP incorporate principles from systems engineering, security, resilience, and risk management.

Cyber resiliency addresses the ability to anticipate, withstand, recover from, and adapt to adverse conditions, stresses, attacks, or compromises on systems that use or are enabled by cyber resources.Consequently, cyber resilience engineering is defined as follows:

"Engineering that intends to architect, design, develop, implement, maintain, and sustain the trustworthiness of systems with the capability to anticipate, withstand, recover from, and adapt to adverse conditions, stresses, attacks, or compromises that use or are enabled by cyber resources."

The NIST-SP 800-160 defines cyber resilience and offers a set of goals, objectives, techniques and approaches, design principles, and clarifies the relationship between various cyber resiliency constructs. Notably, this SP emphasizes that cyber resiliency differs with the life cycle of a system and calls for the need for customized goals and objectives that benefit stakeholders at every stage of the system’s life cycle. Additionally, the document provides guidance for adapting cyber resiliency to different kinds of environments such as enterprise systems, cyber physical systems, and critical infrastructure systems, among others.
