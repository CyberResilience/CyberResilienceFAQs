**October 2023**


**What is cyber resilience?**
Cyber resilience is achieved by making it costly and difficult for intruders to break into our environment and maintain presence in the systems, as well as strengthening the system-of-system’s ability to recover business functions after adversity. One of the first steps to kick-start a cyber resilience program is by identifying critical data, processes and systems that are high value assets and develop plans to address gaps in resilience. Once identified, those key assets can be designed, implemented and maintained appropriately by leveraging existing cyber resilience best practices. This perspective is particularly relevant to address Advanced Persistent Threats (APT) which may execute a coordinated, destructive long-lasting attack towards an organization. APT actors aim to compromise not only the most vulnerable or less protected assets in order to carry out their mission. In fact, they may specifically decide to attack assets that can provide them maximum gain towards the achievement of their objectives. These assets are referred to as high-value targets.
Cyber resilience lies at the intersection of two broad domains in business and technology. Consequently, the application of cyber resilience to each of these domains may be stated as follows. 
Business domain: In the business domain, cyber resilience is an outcome of cyber security and operational resilience. As per the 2022 World Economic Forum (WEF)’s report on cyber resilience, it is defined as “the ability of an organization to transcend any stresses, failures, hazards and threats to its cyber resources within the organization and its ecosystem, such that the organization can confidently pursue its mission, enable its culture and maintain its desired way of operating” (WEF, 2022).
Technical domain – In this domain, cyber resilience is designed and implemented as an extension of cyber security and is defined as “the ability to anticipate, withstand, recover from, and adapt to adverse conditions, stresses, attacks, or compromises on systems that use or are enabled by cyber resources. Cyber resilience is intended to enable mission or business objectives that depend on cyber resources to be achieved in a contested cyber environment.” Additional material may be found in the NIST publication SP 800-160 v2 r1 and in the MITRE CREF publication.
Further definitions of cyber resilience are found in the appendix. 

**What is the relationship between cyber resilience and business resilience?**
Business resilience is the ability for a business or organization to continue to move forward with its business purpose while reacting and recovering to unknown challenges. It is generally a key driver for any risk program. Business resilience, and the policies and tolerances that are agreed upon by the risk office should be the drivers for a cyber resilience program. In other words, a cyber resilience program should fulfill the goals of a business resilience plan or program, where technology is concerned. See Linkov and Kott (2019) and Björck et al (2015) for an expanded narrative.

**How is NIST SP800-160 relevant for cyber resilience?**
NIST’s SP 800-160 series focuses on systems security. Its first volume, released in 2018, was focused on secure systems engineering and used approaches from a range of engineering disciplines to inform its guidelines on the development of trustworthy secure systems. The second volume of SP 800-160, released in 2021, is however, exclusively focused on the topic of cyber resilience. The focus of Vol. 2 is to work in conjunction with the earlier released guidelines on systems engineering in Vol. 1. Additionally, the CISA has published a Cyber Resiliency Review, which is a free, voluntary, non-technical assessment to evaluate an organization’s operational resilience and cybersecurity practices. CISA has also made available a mapping framework linking the NIST’s Cyber Security Framework (CSF) to the CISA’s Cyber Resiliency Review (CRR).
The NIST SP 800-160 (Vol. 2 Revision 1, 2021) is focused on the development of cyber resilient systems. In the current landscape of still-evolving cyber resilience frameworks, the NIST SP 800-16 Vol. 2 is one of the major frameworks that comprehensively addresses cyber resilience. Some other frameworks for cyber-resilience that have been developed include those put forth in whitepapers by the MITRE and World Economic Forum. Adopting a systems-engineering foundation, this SP incorporate principles from systems engineering, security, resilience, and risk management. (Note: NIST SP 800-160- Vol.1 first published in 2016, is focused on the development of multidisciplinary approaches for engineering secure and trustworthy systems.)
The NIST SP 800-172 definition of cyber resilience states that cyber resilience is the ability to anticipate, withstand, recover from, and adapt to adverse conditions, stresses, attacks, or compromises on systems that use or are enabled by cyber resources. Consequently, cyber resilience engineering has been defined as follows:
Engineering that intends to architect, design, develop, implement, maintain, and sustain the trustworthiness of systems with the capability to anticipate, withstand, recover from, and adapt to adverse conditions, stresses, attacks, or compromises that use or are enabled by cyber resources.
The NIST-SP 800-160 defines cyber resilience and offers a set of four goals (anticipate, withstand, recover, adapt) and eight objectives (prevent/avoid, prepare, continue, constrain, reconstitute, understand, transform, re-architect). In addition, this framework offers a set of fourteen techniques and approaches, strategic and structural design principles, and clarifies the relationship between various cyber resilience constructs.
Notably, this Special Publication (SP) emphasizes that cyber resilience differs with the life cycle of a system and calls for the need for customized goals and objectives that benefit stakeholders at every stage of the system’s life cycle. Additionally, the document provides guidance for adapting cyber resilience to different kinds of environments such as enterprise systems, cyber physical systems, and critical infrastructure systems, among others.

**Why should businesses invest in increasing cyber resilience?**
Enhancing cyber resilience is essential for businesses to safeguard critical infrastructure, data, and systems against sophisticated cyber threats. By adopting a comprehensive Cyber Resilience strategy based on standards like NIST SP 800-53, NIST SP 800-34, and NIST SP 800-160, organizations can effectively identify, respond to, and recover from cyber incidents, minimizing downtime and financial impact. The NIST SP 800-160 states that “a systems security engineering approach can result in more effective, efficient, dependable, and resilient systems". Such an approach, in combination with NIST SP 800-34's focus on contingency planning enables businesses to garner customer trust and increase security ROI though resilience not only as an outcome, but as a competitive advantage, while ensuring compliance to industry best practices in terms of defense in depth.
